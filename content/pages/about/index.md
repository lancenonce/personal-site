I was born in Harvey, IL and currently reside in North Carolina. I like to write about cryptoeconomics, computer science, history, and philosophy. If you have any feedback on my work or want to get in touch, feel free to send over a message or an email! 

#### Professional
I studied computer engineering at North Carolina A&T with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I've always had an affinity for technology. I've built mobile apps with React Native and Flutter, an NFC reader interface, machine learning models, web apps, decentralized apps, and more. My favorite disciplines are artificial intelligence and cryptography. I also am fascinated by cryptoeconomics and token engineering. 

#### Personal
In my spare time, I like to read, write, play piano, and watch action movies / shows. I like all types of music; my favorite artist is Kendrick Lamar. When I'm not thinking, I like to spend time in nature and in meditation. I'm a 6 year yogi and a gym lover. The best way to get my attention is to share valuable information!
